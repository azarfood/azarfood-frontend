# Azarfood

![Azarfood](./src/app/icon.png)

This is a `Node-v20.17.0` and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[Live Demo](https://azarfood-frontend.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

If you don't have the `pnpm` installed already, install it with the following commands:

```bash
# using corepack:
corepack enable

# or using npm
npm i --global pnpm
```

then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

You can run the following commands in the project scope:

```bash

# run the development server
pnpm dev

# format the project
pnpm format

# lint the project
pnpm lint

# build the project
pnpm build

# preview the build result
pnpm start
```

For the dev and preview server, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Vazirmant and Montserrat Google Fonts.

### Using version manager

You can run the command `nvm use` for switching to the correct node version.

#### Using with direnv

If you have `direnv` installed, you can enable the nvm env using the command `direnv allow` to change node version automatically when inside project root.
