## Getting Started

If you don't have the `pnpm` installed already, install it with the following commands:

```bash
# using corepack:
corepack enable

# or using npm
npm i --global pnpm
```

then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

You can run the following commands in the project scope:

```bash

# run the development server
pnpm dev

# format the project
pnpm format

# lint the project
pnpm lint

# build the project
pnpm build

# preview the build result
pnpm start
```

For the dev and preview server, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Vazirmant and Montserrat Google Fonts.
